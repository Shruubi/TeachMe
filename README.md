About
-----

This project is a simple collection of classes, which are heavily commented, meant to help educate people on
possible ways to implement certain .NET collections. This is meant as a programming instructional tool and 
probably should not be used in any production manner, unless of course, my implementation is awesome, in which
case use it all you want.
